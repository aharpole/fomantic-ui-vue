# `fomantic-ui-vue`

## Goal

The goal is to build a `vue.js` library of templates to use Fomantic UI.

## Progress

At the moment a very small part of the library has been realised. Of the elements only `button`, `icon` and `image` is somehow complete.

## What there is to see

### A *nearly* documentation

If you what to see what is already done and in which direction the library is going, clone the repo, then
```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Tests

You can run the tests by executing in the root directory
```bash
npm install
npm run test
# or
npm run test:watch
```
